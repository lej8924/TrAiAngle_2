## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up the project locally.

#### Setting Up Environment

```
    Python 3.9.19
    Node 21.3.0
    NPM 10.2.4
    OS: MacOS (or Linux)
    (In Windows, There are commands that Windows does not support, such as rm and cp. And path settings for file I/O are also incompatible with Windows systems)
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo and change directory to that folder

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CreamMeatball/TrAiAngle.git
    ```

2. Create the Virtual Environment with Python 3.9.19 version.

   I create the Virtual Environment by using IDE PyCharm.
   
   Additionally, the pip version in python 3.9.19 Virtual Environment is 23.2.1
   
   And you should install Node and NPM.
   
   Node : 21.3.0
   
   NPM : 10.2.4

4. Install all project dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Certain libraries must use the same version as specified in requirements.txt.

5. Move to 'web' directory by using command 'cd web' from root directory.

6. In 'web' directory, install Tools for Web Frontend

   ```
   npm run install:all
   ```

7. Create a directory for the resulting files to be stored.

   Create a folder
   
   - media : root/web/server/static/media
   - images : root/web/server/static/images
  
8. Migration

   In directory, 'root/web/server/',
   
   migrate with 'manage.py'.
   
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

9. Finally, run server and access the web.

   In directory, 'root/web',
   
   run the server with below command.
   
   ```
   npm run start:website
   ```

   Then you can access the web in url 'http://127.0.0.1:8000"
